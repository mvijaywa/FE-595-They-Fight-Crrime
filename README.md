# FE-595-They-Fight-Crrime

The project contains 3 scripts files namely :
1) First_script.py
2) Second_script.py
3) Third_Script.py

The first script primarily takes your stevens username(enter your stevens username here)
and the password(enter your setevens password here) and logs into the website
The download path is changed to the one where you want all the files(txt/csv) to be saved. 
This script downloads all the files from the discyssion section of the course and merges all the male and female characters.


The second script basically takes all the "she" and "he" characters and finds the sentiment using textblob separately. All the results are stored in pandas dataframe. To get the best and the worst characters the df is sorted on polarity.

The third script prints the 10 most common descriptions for the characters. 

The output will be printed on the output console of your IDE.
